\section*{Introduction}

This report is composed of two preliminary parts: the first about interpolation methods and the second about integration methods.
\medbreak
The first part deals with the Cubic Spline interpolation method, which enables us to interpolate a function using a set of points.
This method is applied to a set of points of the goe05k airfoil, in order to obtain a smooth curve, which will be used in the third part.
\medbreak
The second part deals with the integration of a function, comparing the trapezoidal rule, the Simpson rule, the Romberg method, as well as the epsilon-integration method.
\medbreak
To conclude, the last part consists in applying the previous methods on an airfoil to obtain a pressure map around it, as well as the trajectories of air particles around it.
